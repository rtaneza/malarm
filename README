malarm is a simple maemo alarm app for Nokia N8xx devices.

	http://github.com/rtaneza/malarm/tree

I wrote this primarily to learn maemo / gnome programming, and because the default nokia alarm app does not have an enable/disable function (i.e. do not remove an alarm, just disable it). Some other features planned are:

	- timer mode (set alarm x minutes from now)
	- monthly and yearly recurrence (will have to add multiple alarm events)

The app framework (autotool files, etc.) is based on the hhwX.c (hello hildon) sample app by Nokia.
